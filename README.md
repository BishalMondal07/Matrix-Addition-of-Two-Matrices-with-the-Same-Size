# Matrix Addition using Python
This Python program adds two matrices of the same size. It prompts the user to input the dimensions and values of the matrices, performs the addition, and outputs the resulting matrix.

# Usage
1. Install Python 3 on your computer if it is not already installed.
2. Download the Python file matrix_addition.py.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where matrix_addition.py is saved.
4. Run the program by typing python matrix_addition.py.
5. Enter the number of rows and columns for the matrices when prompted.
6. Enter the values for each element in the matrices when prompted.
7. The program will add the matrices and print the resulting matrix.

# Input Validation
The program checks that the matrices are of the same size before performing the addition. If the matrices are not of the same size, the program raises a ValueError.

# Example

Suppose the user enters the following matrices:

```bash
Enter the value of m: 2
Enter the value of n: 2
Enter Matrix A
Enter O[0][0]1
Enter O[0][1]2
Enter O[1][0]3
Enter O[1][1]4
Enter Matrix B
Enter O[0][0]5
Enter O[0][1]6
Enter O[1][0]7
Enter O[1][1]8
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
[[6, 8], [10, 12]]

```
